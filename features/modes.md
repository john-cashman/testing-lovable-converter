At Lovable, you can work with AI in two powerful modes:

## 1. Edit Mode

**Edit Mode** is your AI developer. It writes code, adds new features, and updates your project—automatically. This is the default mode when you start using Lovable.

## 2. Chat Mode

**Chat Mode** is your development partner and is **10x smarter**. It helps you think through problems, debug issues, and plan your product—directly within the Lovable Editor.

Unlike Edit Mode, Chat Mode is conversational and doesn't make edits to the code. This is perfect for asking questions, planning your project, and debugging. This mode is agentic, meaning it can reason across multiple steps and decide when to search files, inspect logs, query the database, and more. Then, when you're ready, simply prompt: “`Implement the plan`”.

This switches you back to Edit Mode, where Lovable turns those ideas into working code.

### Switching Modes

Click the **“Chat”** prompt at the bottom of your editor to toggle between Edit and Chat Modes.

When you're in Chat Mode and say “implement the plan,” Lovable will seamlessly switch to Edit Mode and start building for you.

**Top 15 Chat Mode Use Cases**

 1. **Efficient debugging** by explaining errors, offering step-by-step breakdowns, and resolving issues when Lovable got stuck in loops.
 2. **Optimized feature implementation** by identifying the minimal necessary changes required for new functionality.
 3. **Effective system architecture**, planning database structures, relationships, and scalability strategies.
 4. **Streamlined development**, collecting and refining feature ideas before implementation.
 5. **Informed product decisions**, such as debating whether to fork a product or consolidate functions.
 6. **Enhanced documentation and knowledge storage**, keeping development organized and reducing redundant prompts.
 7. **Debugging Lovable itself**, such as redeploying edge functions when Supabase connections were lost.
 8. **Guidance for non-specialists**, acting as an AI tutor for troubleshooting, from password resets to API integrations.
 9. **Prompt generation and refinement**, improving workflows through clearer, more precise instructions.
10. **Decision-making assistance**, analyzing multiple solutions before executing changes.
11. **Product management support**, structuring features, onboarding flows, and pricing models.
12. **Improved collaboration**, acting as a bridge between developers and non-technical founders.
13. **Reduced trial-and-error**, preventing mistakes before they happen and saving hours of work.
14. **Better AI-generated code quality**, refining outputs for maintainability, performance, and best practices.
15. **Real-time coding feedback**, offering suggestions to improve readability, efficiency, and adherence to standards.

Chat Mode transforms the no-code/low-code experience, bridging ideas and fully functional products. It bridges the gap between great ideas and fully functional products, making complex software **accessible** to founders who previously relied on engineers.
