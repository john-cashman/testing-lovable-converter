Once your web app is ready, you can **deploy it** and share it with the world. You also have the option to **share a work-in-progress version** to gather feedback before going live. Lovable makes it simple to publish, iterate, and distribute your applications with just a few clicks.

## Publishing your app

When your project is ready, **publish it to generate a shareable URL.** This makes it easy to showcase your application or share it with collaborators and stakeholders.
