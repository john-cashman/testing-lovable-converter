Learn how to go from idea to a fully functional, animated landing page, using AI \+ a sprinkle of razzle dazzle.

## Two Ways to Build Landing Pages

### 1. One-Shot Generation

Let Lovable do the heavy lifting. Just write a single prompt and let the AI generate your entire landing page.

**Prompt Example:**

```
You are a CRO expert. Build a landing page for a space tourism agency targeting wealthy individuals. The experience includes zero-gravity flights. Follow conversion rate optimization best practices. 
```

### 2. Section-by-Section

Prefer more control? Build one piece at a time: hero, pricing, FAQs, and more.

**Example flow:**

    - Space theme ðŸŒŒ
    - Animations
    - Dark mode
    - Horse mascot (obviously)
    - Pricing & FAQs
