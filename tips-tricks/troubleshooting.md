## "Try to Fix" error loops

Building with Lovable makes coding faster and more intuitiveâ€”but even the best AI development tools can occasionally hit a snag. Sometimes your code won't run as expected, or you might notice unexpected behavior where the AI interprets your intent incorrectly.

Here's a step-by-step guide to help you navigate issues and get back on track:

    - **Delete a branch:** Use the GitHub interface (not available directly in Lovable)
    - **Default branch:** Set in GitHub repository settings

    If you can't switch branches:

    - Commit or stash any uncommitted changes
    - Check if you have untracked files that would be overwritten

## Comprehensive Debugging Manual

[This document](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1dfIy5rtkPN9Zi4smX1VAbfbhAiEyBvVw8p7B8kJiEVs/edit?tab=t.0) or [this website](https://kb-lovable.netlify.app/?tab=errors#errors) were written by a Lovable power user in our Discord community.

### How to use it

1. **Download** it as `Comprehensive_Debugging_Manual.md`.
2. **Upload** it to your GitHub project.
3. Prompt Lovable: "Read this document. Let me know if it helps. Then create a prompt I should use to troubleshoot this issue."
4. After Lovable responds, say: "Before you proceed, explain in detail why you think this will work. Wait for my approval."

This ensures deeper understanding before implementing any fix.
