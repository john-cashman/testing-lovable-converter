Currently, Lovable does not support direct uploads of custom fonts. 

However, there are several easy ways to use web-safe or incorporate custom fonts into your projects. Below, weâ€™ll guide you through the available methods for **using web-safe** and **Google fonts**:

    If you want to use a web-safe font in your project, you can specify the font directly in your prompt. For example, if you want to use **Courier New** for a heading or title in the hero section, simply reference the font by name in your prompt.

    ```text
    Use Courier New as the heading font in the hero section for the main title.
    ```

    Web-safe fonts like Courier New ensure that your project will have consistent typography across all platforms without requiring external resources to load the font. However, they can limit your creativity. Lucikly, there are otions like the ability to use Google Fonts.
