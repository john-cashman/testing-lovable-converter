    To help you better understand how to integrate images using the methods outlined above, we have a project you can explore: [Lovable Project Example](https://lovable.dev/projects/e823fedf-238d-4313-86a8-1fd4bfc2a9ba). In this project, you can see the actual prompts and how each method works in practice.
