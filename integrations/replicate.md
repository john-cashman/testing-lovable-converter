## What is Replicate

[Replicate](https://replicate.com/) lets you run open-source machine learning models with just a few lines of code—no ML expertise required.

It’s an API platform where developers can generate images, videos, audio, and more using community-built or custom AI models. Whether you’re building an MVP, prototyping creative features, or adding production-grade AI to your app, Replicate gives you fast, flexible access to state-of-the-art models.

## Why use Replicate with Lovable?

Replicate fits naturally into Lovable’s AI-first app-building workflow. You can:

- Generate dynamic visuals (e.g. course banners, avatars, scenes)
- Use multimodal AI (image, video, speech, text-to-speech)
- Add real-time content generation without running your own model infrastructure

With Lovable’s built-in knowledge of Replicate’s API and models, integration takes minutes—not days. Just describe what you want, and Lovable handles the rest.

## Step by Step Tutorial

In this tutorial, we walk through how to integrate Replicate into a Lovable application to dynamically generate course banner images, adding a new layer of interactivity and polish to your product. You’ll also learn how Replicate fits into Lovable’s broader AI workflow—including how to pair it with OpenAI for course content, Superbase for backend logic, and real-time AI conversations using [OpenAI’s WebRTC API](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/realtime#connect-with-webrtc).

    **Example Response Handling:**

    Some Replicate models return a single image URL, others return an array. Make sure your Lovable function correctly extracts the output, e.g.:

    ```
    const imageUrl = response.output[0]
    ```

## Tips & Gotchas

- **Model Output Variance**: Replicate models differ in how they return outputs. Always inspect the actual JSON returned from the playground.
- **Prompt Iteration is Key**: Small prompt changes can greatly affect image quality. Use the playground to experiment.
- **Backend Logs**: Use Supabase Edge logs to debug your API calls. Lovable supports in-app log fetching.
- **Version Control in Lovable**: Each prompt edit is auto-committed, but you can manually track checkpoints using the “Deploy” feature for production-ready states.
