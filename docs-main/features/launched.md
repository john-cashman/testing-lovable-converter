## Best practices 

Launching a product is exciting—but getting people to actually use it? That’s the real challenge. Whether you’re rolling out a side project, a SaaS tool, or a community-driven app, your **first 100 users** set the foundation for everything that follows. This isn’t about magic hacks or vanity metrics. It’s about practical, low-cost strategies to get real users who care about what you’re building.

Getting your first 100 users isn’t about luck—it’s about being intentional with your approach. Start with what’s free and available: existing networks, community engagement, content, and targeted outreach. **Test what works, double down, and iterate.**
