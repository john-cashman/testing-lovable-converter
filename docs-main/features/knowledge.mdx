Every project has its own unique context, goals, and challenges. A knowledge file captures this **custom context** and serves as a living document that evolves with your project.

## **What to Include in Your Knowledge File**

A comprehensive knowledge file covers all essential aspects of your project. Here’s a breakdown of what to include:

- **Project Overview:** A brief description of the project, its goals, and objectives.
- **User Personas:** Detailed descriptions of your target users and their needs.
- **Feature Specifications:** User stories, acceptance criteria, and detailed descriptions of each feature.
- **Design Assets:** Links to design files, color palettes, typography, and other visual elements.
- **API Documentation:** Detailed API endpoints, request/response examples, and authentication methods.
- **Database Schema:** ER diagrams, table structures, and relationships.
- **Environment Setup:** Instructions for setting up the development environment, including dependencies and configurations.
- **Testing Guidelines:** Types of tests, testing frameworks, and coverage requirements.
- **Deployment Instructions:** Steps for deploying the application to different environments (development, staging, production).
- **Version Control Practices:** Define your branching strategy, commit message conventions, and code review guidelines.
- **Security Practices:** Guidelines for secure coding, data protection, and handling sensitive information.
- **Compliance Requirements:** Any legal or regulatory requirements your project must adhere to.

## **Best Practices for Maintaining Knowledge Files**

- **Start Early:** Use tools like Lovable’s experimental chat mode to generate a knowledge file at the beginning of your project.
- **Keep It Dynamic:** Automate updates to ensure your knowledge file stays in sync with your codebase and documentation.
- **Define Roles Clearly:** Assign ownership to different sections to ensure accountability and avoid outdated information.
