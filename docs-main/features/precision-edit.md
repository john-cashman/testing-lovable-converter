## Visual Edits&#x20;

Lovable makes programming accessible to non-technical users while ensuring designers have precise control. **Visual Edits** allows AI-driven development with Tailwind-native visual controls for easy refinement.

#### How It Works

* **Activate** the tool from the editor toolbar.

* **Hover & Click** on UI elements (buttons, text, images) to edit.

* **Modify Attributes** like text, colors, layout, font weights, and image sizes.

* **Select Parent Elements** for structural changes.

* **Use AI-Powered Prompts** for complex adjustments.

* **Preview in Real-Time** and save when satisfied.

This streamlines UI refinements, combining AI assistance with manual precision.

## **Figma Integration**

Export Figma designs directly into Lovable to build full-stack apps without coding.

## Knowledge Files

Every project has its own unique context, goals, and challenges. A knowledge file captures this **custom context** and serves as a living document that evolves with your project.&#x20;

### **What to Include in Your Knowledge File**

A comprehensive knowledge file covers all essential aspects of your project. Here’s a breakdown of what to include:

* **Project Overview:** A brief description of the project, its goals, and objectives.

* **User Personas:** Detailed descriptions of your target users and their needs.

* **Feature Specifications:** User stories, acceptance criteria, and detailed descriptions of each feature.

* **Design Assets:** Links to design files, color palettes, typography, and other visual elements.

* **API Documentation:** Detailed API endpoints, request/response examples, and authentication methods.

* **Database Schema:** ER diagrams, table structures, and relationships.

* **Environment Setup:** Instructions for setting up the development environment, including dependencies and configurations.

* **Testing Guidelines:** Types of tests, testing frameworks, and coverage requirements.

* **Deployment Instructions:** Steps for deploying the application to different environments (development, staging, production).

* **Version Control Practices:** Define your branching strategy, commit message conventions, and code review guidelines.

* **Security Practices:** Guidelines for secure coding, data protection, and handling sensitive information.

* **Compliance Requirements:** Any legal or regulatory requirements your project must adhere to.

### **Best Practices for Maintaining Knowledge Files**

* **Start Early:** Use tools like Lovable’s experimental chat mode to generate a knowledge file at the beginning of your project.

* **Keep It Dynamic:** Automate updates to ensure your knowledge file stays in sync with your codebase and documentation.

* **Define Roles Clearly:** Assign ownership to different sections to ensure accountability and avoid outdated information.
