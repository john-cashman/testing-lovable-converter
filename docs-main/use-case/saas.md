## Tips for SaaS Builders

### Be Explicit

- Always describe what _you want_ and what _you see_.
- Use screenshots to clarify bugs or layouts.

### Work Step-by-Step

- UI first → database → auth → core features → AI → payments

### Debug Like a Pro

- Use chat mode to fix build errors or broken logic
- Revert changes if necessary (does not revert database schema)

### Save Tokens

- Use custom knowledge to store consistent instructions (theme, mobile responsiveness)
