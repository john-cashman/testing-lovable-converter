At this time, Lovable doesn't fully support team plans or multiple users on the same project. We are actively considering this feature for future updates. However, we've noticed that some users have found a workaround for collaborating on the same project.

The workaround involves creating a single account (registering through the regular sign-up process) and then sharing the credentials for that account with the users you want to give access to.

This allows multiple people to log in and work on the same project (not at the same time, however!)

Please note that this is not an officially supported feature of Lovable but rather a workaround that we've observed users employing.

We recommend considering the risks before proceeding with this method.
