Lovable makes it easy to integrate AI services into your web applications. Whether you want to build an AI-powered landing page, a text-generation tool, or a full SaaS app, Lovable's built-in integrations with services like [**OpenAI**](https://platform.openai.com/)**, **[**Groq**](https://console.groq.com/keys)**, **[**Claude**](https://www.anthropic.com/api)**, **[**Deepseek**](https://api-docs.deepseek.com/)**, and **[**Mistral**](https://docs.mistral.ai/api/) make it possible without writing backend code.

## **Debug and Improve Prompts**

- Be specific with system messages: "You are a helpful nutritionist."
- Test function calling by mocking inputs.
- Use `console.log()` inside edge functions to trace logic.
- Use screenshots when asking Lovable to debug a layout.

**Prompt Tip:** If the AI fails to use your context (e.g. user's meals), say:

```
Make sure all of the user's meals are included in the prompt to GPT-4.
```
